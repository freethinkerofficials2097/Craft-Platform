// structle-server.js
// STRUCTLE - a BLINDLE-style TikTok LIVE word game modelled on "MORPH-O".
// Same platform machinery as BLINDLE (unlimited guesses, clue-consistency check,
// leaderboards, celebration, Live/Test/Offline modes, hints, difficulty, engagement
// alerts) with a different clue system based on the SHAPE of the letters:
//   - Every capital letter is built from a number of STRAIGHT lines and CURVES
//     (see LETTER_SHAPES below - e.g. A = 3 straight, 0 curves; S = 0 straight, 1 curve).
//   - Each guess shows two numbers to the right of the word:
//       first  column (straight-line symbol) = how far the guess's total number of
//                                              straight lines is from the hidden word's (>= 0),
//       second column (curve symbol)         = the same for the total number of curves.
//   - The round is WON the moment BOTH numbers are 0 - i.e. the guess has exactly the
//     same total straight lines AND total curves as the hidden word. It does NOT have to
//     be the hidden word itself: any real word with the same two totals is accepted
//     and earns 1 point.
//   - There is no keyboard and no coloring - the two numbers are the whole clue.
//   - ANY real word of the right length is accepted as a guess - there is no
//     "must be consistent with earlier clues" rule, so viewers can freely test any
//     word they think might fit. (Words that are not in the dictionary, or have
//     the wrong number of letters, are simply ignored.)
//   - A word that was ALREADY guessed this round is not added again; a short
//     "Already guessed" note is shown with the two numbers that word got.
//
// Transport: runs on its own Socket.IO namespace "/structle" (like COLORDLE), so
// it never collides with BLINDLE's raw WebSocketServer.
//
// (Original BLINDLE header follows.)
// BLINDLE - faithful to the real word500.com feedback mechanic:
//   - Each guess only reveals COUNTS: how many letters are green
//     (right letter, right spot), yellow (right letter, wrong spot),
//     and red (not in the word) - never which letters those are.
//
// Adapted for a fully automated TikTok LIVE audience:
//   - Guessing is UNLIMITED. Anyone can guess, any number of times.
//     There is no attempt pool and no per-round voting window - every
//     matching chat comment is evaluated immediately.
//   - The catch: a guess is only accepted if it's logically CONSISTENT
//     with every clue already revealed this round (i.e. it could still
//     be the answer, given what's been learned so far). A guess that
//     contradicts an earlier clue is rejected with a brief on-screen
//     note - this is what keeps unlimited guessing meaningful instead
//     of just spamming random words.
//   - The on-screen keyboard AND each guessed word's letter tiles are
//     a manual, host-only scratchpad - click to cycle red -> yellow ->
//     green -> none. The server never colors anything automatically.
//   - Hints are unlimited and suggest a word consistent with every
//     clue so far - but never the literal secret word.
//   - Difficulty (Normal / Medium / Hard) is a 4-factor score over
//     vocabulary, word structure, candidate ambiguity, and feedback
//     informativeness - see difficulty.js. It controls which secret
//     words are eligible, not how much information is given.
//
// This build also adds three modes for a TikTok LIVE context:
//   - Live    : real TikTok LIVE chat, guesses count toward leaderboards
//   - Test    : simulated fake chat, same mechanics, scores NOT saved
//   - Offline : host types guesses directly, no chat/leaderboard involved
// In Live and Test, the host can also directly set the secret word at
// any time from the bottom control bar.
