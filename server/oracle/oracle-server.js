// oracle-server.js
// ORACLE - a BLINDLE variant inspired by "SEER-O". Everything is BLINDLE's system
// (unlimited guesses, consistency check, points, leaderboards, celebration, Live/Test/
// Offline modes, hints, difficulty, engagement alerts) EXCEPT the clue columns:
//   - Each guess shows THREE numbers, but the order of the three columns
//     (green / yellow / red) is SHUFFLED at the start of every round, and the
//     audience is never told which column is which.
//   - Because the order is unknown, each earlier clue is checked on its own: a guess
//     is accepted if it fits every clue under SOME column order (the order may differ
//     from clue to clue - see checkConsistency).
//   - The three columns stay UNCOLORED for the whole round. Colors are only
//     revealed when the round ends (solved, or the host gives up).
//   - The server NEVER sends the color mapping (or true green/yellow/red counts)
//     to browsers while a round is in progress - only the shuffled numbers.
//
// Transport: unlike BLINDLE (raw WebSocket on /blindle-ws), ORACLE runs on its own
// Socket.IO namespace "/oracle" so it can never collide with BLINDLE's WebSocketServer.
//
// (Original BLINDLE header follows.)
// BLINDLE - faithful to the real word500.com feedback mechanic:
//   - Each guess only reveals COUNTS: how many letters are green
//     (right letter, right spot), yellow (right letter, wrong spot),
//     and red (not in the word) - never which letters those are.
//
// Adapted for a fully automated TikTok LIVE audience:
//   - Guessing is UNLIMITED. Anyone can guess, any number of times.
//     There is no attempt pool and no per-round voting window - every
//     matching chat comment is evaluated immediately.
//   - The catch: a guess is only accepted if it's logically CONSISTENT
//     with every clue already revealed this round (i.e. it could still
//     be the answer, given what's been learned so far). A guess that
//     contradicts an earlier clue is rejected with a brief on-screen
//     note - this is what keeps unlimited guessing meaningful instead
//     of just spamming random words.
//   - The on-screen keyboard AND each guessed word's letter tiles are
//     a manual, host-only scratchpad - click to cycle red -> yellow ->
//     green -> none. The server never colors anything automatically.
//   - Hints are unlimited and suggest a word consistent with every
//     clue so far - but never the literal secret word.
//   - Difficulty (Normal / Medium / Hard) is a 4-factor score over
//     vocabulary, word structure, candidate ambiguity, and feedback
//     informativeness - see difficulty.js. It controls which secret
//     words are eligible, not how much information is given.
//
// This build also adds three modes for a TikTok LIVE context:
//   - Live    : real TikTok LIVE chat, guesses count toward leaderboards
//   - Test    : simulated fake chat, same mechanics, scores NOT saved
//   - Offline : host types guesses directly, no chat/leaderboard involved
// In Live and Test, the host can also directly set the secret word at
// any time from the bottom control bar.
